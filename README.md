# coding-practice-competitive-dsa
### This repository contains all of the cp/dsa or any other practice coding work on my local machine. The only purpose of having this is to establish a daily habit of working on my problem solving/competitive coding skills.
### It also contains the exercises and assignments I do as I follow along to the Competitive Coding Essentials course on Udemy.
